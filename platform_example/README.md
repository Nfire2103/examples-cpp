# platform_example
A very simple demo that shows platformer style motion, sprites, collision, and camera work

Use A and D to run left and right
Use Space to Jump, and S+Space to drop down.


Code shows how to manage actor states and manage animation frames for sprite animation at different frame rates from a sprite sheet.
