# Pew-cpp
A very simple game that shows time based movement, shooting and collision deection.

Use A and D to turn the tank, use W and S to move it.
Use the mouse to aim the turret and click to fire.
Shoot the targets, don't run into them.
Every 10 targets destoryed adds a new one.
You have 3 lives

Code shows how to use math to convert angles into vectors and apply those vectors to motion, using frame rate independent speeds.
